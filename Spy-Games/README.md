# Project Overview

**Problem Statement**

Hello lieutenant! It's with an emergency that our agency wishes to use the skills that you learned in 'python intermediate' module. 
Your mission if you choose to accept it, would be to help us decipher a message that we received from our intel. We have multiple text files that need to be read and have certain operations performed to get our final message.
