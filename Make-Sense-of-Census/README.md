# Project Overview

**Problem Statement**

You have been hired by 'CACT'(Census Analysis and Collection Team) to help with your numpy programming skills. Your major work for today involves census record management and data analysis.


**Learnings from the project**

After completing this project, I have a better grip on working with numpy. In this project,I applied the following concepts:

1. Array Appending
2. Array Slicing
3. Array Filtering
4. Array Aggregation

**Approach taken to solve the problem**

Breaking down the problem into small key tasks is valuable and getting acquainted with various functions in the libraries helps as well.

**Challenges faced**

Although the approach was clear, going about the same required a lot of reading of Python library manuals so as to fully utilise the functionality .
